TReactr is a javascript digital DJ mixing application built for the modern web, based on the legendary UI from Native Instruments' Traktor.

## Features:
- Stream music from Youtube or Soundcloud
- Apply EQ's and filter to html5 audio sources

## TReactr is brought to you by:
Node.js, Express, GraphQL, React, Babel, ESLint, PostCSS, Webpack, and Browsersync.

## Install:
This project uses `yarn` for managing packages, running build scripts, and starting the development server.
If you don't already have `yarn` you can install it with:

  npm install -g yarn

To install TReactr, use:

  yarn

This is equivalent to `yarn install` or `npm install`.

## Run:
To start a dev server and launch TReactr in your browser, use:

  yarn start

This is equivalent to `npm start`.

For a full list of scripts that can be ran with `yarn` or `npm`, see `package.json`.

## Contributing:
The easiest way to start contributing is to check out the deployment on Heroku and open up an issue if you have problems with it.

If you want to help with development, there's a to-do list of small features that need to be implemented in the Wiki.

If you like thinking about the bigger picture, we have a build/release plan on the Wiki as well. TReactr will be officially released sometime in late 2017.
